 ## Gaavei
 ### Introduction

 Gaavei (Mean Love in Greek and Author in Cambodia) is a music co-ownership platform for web3 collectives to pool resources and own share revenue together through NFTs.

Gaavei enable artists to forge a more direct relationship with their collector community. By helping to circumvent larger platforms, music NFTs give artists the chance to build a more direct connection with their fan base, who can also benefit from new ways of interaction and ownership.

### Problem

Currently, many artists find it difficult to see significant returns on streaming platforms. According to [some estimates](https://soundcamps.com/spotify-royalties-calculator/), one stream on Spotify amounts to about $0.004 paid to the artist, meaning that one million streams net roughly $4000. Getting that many streams isn’t realistic for most independent artists. The opportunities for musicians to earn an income have significantly decreased.  It’s important to note that the issue here isn’t necessarily with individual companies but more with the underlying economic model.

The artist doesn’t have to change they way they work, They still producing their music and upload to those steaming provider, by the end quarter they will share the revenue to their early fan who invest in their music but more freedom.
